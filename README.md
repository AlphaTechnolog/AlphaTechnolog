# Gabriel Guerra (AlphaTechnolog)

Hello! My name is Gabriel Guerra (@AlphaTechnolog) and i have 15 years old

I work as webdev and i have 5 years of experience, i'm using linux since 4 years and i'm in really love with that

I love the linux ricing, and now i'm using void linux, but i used the next operative systems too:

- Arch Linux
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Void Linux
- Parrot
- Kali

## Ricing

[nvcodark](https://github.com/AlphaTechnolog/nvcodark) too (nvcodark is broken now, i'm refactorizing a lot of things in the `dev` branch)
