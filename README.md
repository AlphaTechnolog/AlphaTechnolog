Hello! My name is Gabriel Guerra (@AlphaTechnolog) and I'm 17 years old.

I enjoy customizing my linux systems! And here's a list of my favorite linux distros at thte moment.

- Gentoo
- Funtoo
- NixOS
- Bedrock Linux (meta distro tho)
- Debian
- Devuan
- Fedora
- Vanilla OS
- GNU Guix
- Alpine
- Void Linux
- Artix Linux
- Arch Linux
- OpenSUSE {Leap/Tumbleweed}

> Fun fact, i daily drove them all some time too lol

As you can tell, i've a little bit of experience using linux as my day to day workflow, and because of so, i think i've acquired quite some good knowledge about how machines works.

## Programming interests

Recently, i've become really interested on learning about systems programming in general, you can see some projects related to this in the next list:

- [harakara-terminal](https://github.com/alphatechnolog/harakara-terminal): A simple terminal built in zig using gtk and the VTE library.
- [libcommon](https://github.com/alphatechnolog/libcommon): libcommon is a simple library which contains abstractions for some utilities such as dynamic arrays, optionals, defer statements, etc
- [open-repo](https://github.com/alphatechnolog/open-repo): Open git repo straight from your terminal.
- [cutefetch](https://github.com/alphatechnolog/cutefetch): A little fetch utility made with bare c and nice performance.

At the moment of writing, i've been working in some interesting projects like these ones:

- file manager written with bare c using the webview library, which helps using web technologies for the frontend
- zig nas project: This project will help me share my files across my network, for this project i've been writing lots of code in order to make a web server which is capable of fully parsing and working with the http/1.1 protocol, using concurrency for efficient sockets management, render my own views template like blade per example, integrate with vue 3 + vue for a rich development experience, allow me to use tailwind and others modern preprocessors in the same application, serve rest-api-like endpoints while also serving the vue3 pages, etc.
- vbox-manager: A project which will manage my virtualbox machines remotely by providing a frontend and an api for external usage. The api will be done using the zig programming language and the zap framework and the frontend with react and tailwind.

## Ricing

I enjoyed working on these linux-systems-customization projects, which helped me get a fully working workstation while being pleasant to my eyes. Here's a list of my favorite works about this kind of projects.

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/AlphaTechnolog/dotfiles)
- [nixdots](https://github.com/AlphaTechnolog/nixdots)

> Nowadays am using regular gnome and macos for my day to day basis but i really appreciate these projects as a resource of learning for myself.

## Decay

I've been working in a colorscheme/colors palette, called decay... This helped me create an awesome community based around this colorscheme, with plenty of volunters who liked my work and helped me contributing to the project :)
